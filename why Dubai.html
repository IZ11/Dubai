           <h2> <span>1.</span>  View Traditional Architecture at Sheikh Saeed Al-Maktoum House</h2><br>
          <p class="Atr1">Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum was the Ruler of Dubai from 1921 to 1958 and grandfather to the current ruler. His former residence has been rebuilt and restored as a museum that is a fine example of Arabian architecture.

            The original house was built in 1896 by Sheikh Saeed's father, so he could observe shipping activity from the balconies.
            
            It was demolished, but the current house was rebuilt next to the original site, staying true to the original model by incorporating carved teak doors, wooden lattice screens across the windows, and gypsum ventilation screens with floral and geometric designs.
            
            Thirty rooms are built around a central courtyard with wind-tower details on top.

           <h2> <span>3.</span> Haggle in the Souks of Deira</h2><br>
          <p class="Atr1">Deira lies on the northern bank of Dubai Creek, and the winding streets here unveil the melting pot of different nationalities that have come to call Dubai home.

            On the shore, ancient dhows load and unload with modern banks, hotels, and office buildings as a backdrop.
            
            For travelers, Deira is most famous for its traditional souks (markets), which bustle with shoppers at all times of the day.
            
            Deira Gold Souk is world-renowned as the largest gold bazaar in the world.
            
            The Deira Spice Souk sells every imaginable spice, with stalls overflowing with bags of frankincense, cumin, paprika, saffron, sumac, and thyme, as well as the fragrant oud wood, rose water, and incense.

         <h2> <span>4.</span> Flamingos at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary </h2><br>
         <p class="Atr1">You don't have to go too far away from the skyscrapers to soak up a more natural vista.

            The Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary incorporates the mangrove forests and wetlands of Dubai creek.
            
            An important stop-off on the migration routes, it's a prime place to spot flamingos in winter when massive flocks of these majestic pink birds wade through the lagoons, backdropped by soaring high-rises.
            
            Various hides in prime spots have been set up within the park to allow bird-watchers good views of the birdlife.
            
            Address: Ras Al Khor Street, Dubai
